Thanks for the fundamentals!

To make it work with Constellation 8K you have to make a change in on of the SKAARHOJ libraries.



version 4
----------------------------
In version 4 the sketch reads the parameters from a microSD card and deliveres the tally signal of an ATEM switcher. You will need the libraries from SKAARHOJ Open Engineering and 'Rudolph_SD' and 'Rudolph_Error'. Add a LED to PIN6 of the ESP8266.

version 5
----------------------------
Version 5 brings in the wifi manager and enables to change and store the configuration using your web browser. If the device does not find an already known network, it opens up its own wifi. Before using the first time, run the prep.ino once.<br>

You will need the libraries from SKAARHOJ Open Engineering and the WiFiManager.
